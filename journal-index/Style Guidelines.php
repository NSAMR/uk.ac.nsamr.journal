		<div>
			<p>There are many parts to a manuscript. Style guidelines ensure that each article published in a journal appears in the same format. A consistent style is a key part of JNSAMR quality control.<p/>
			<p>JNSAMR includes many of the style guidelines of journals such as The BMJ, The Lancet, and Nature use.<p/>
			<p>Adherence to style guidelines is a key part of an author’s submission process.<p/>

		<div class="left-heading">Why will JNSAMR reject a manuscript that does not adhere to its style guidelines?</div>
		<div>
			<p>JNSAMR will reject any articles that do not adhere to their style guidelines.<p/>
			<p>Style guidelines ensure that the peer review, editing and publication processes run smoothly. It also ensures consistency throughout the journal.<p/>
			<p>JNSAMR operates an open access publishing model with no submission charges for authors. <p/>
			<p>This is rare, most journals operate either by subscription (i.e. non-open access), or by open access with author submission charges. Furthermore, JNSAMR is run by students who volunteer their time.<p/>
			<p>Thus, inline with the majority of journals, JNSAMR does not have the capacity to perform vast numbers of minor edits to amend manuscripts that do not adhere to its style guidelines.<p/>
